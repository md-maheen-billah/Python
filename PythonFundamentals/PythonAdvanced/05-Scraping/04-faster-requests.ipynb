    "\n",
    "If you need even more performances, you will need to use [AsyncIo](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a library to allow you to run asynchronous code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is that more efficiant? Well, when you send a request you need to wait for the response. And during the waiting time, our computer does nothing.\n",
    "If you count all the time the computer is just \"waiting\" on 50 or more requests, you will be surprised to see that most of the computing time is just waiting for the server to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "[AsyncIo](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) allow you to bypass that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as always, it has a cost: complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making your code async will complixify the code a lot and make the debugging not a pleasant experience. Also, you will go so fast that you could be banned by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice? Use it only if you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will show you a simple example but you want to understand it better, I really advice you **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAh5dDODJ5k)**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "In order to simplify a bit the code, I will use [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) a python library that is working the same way as the `requests` module but with few helpers for async."
